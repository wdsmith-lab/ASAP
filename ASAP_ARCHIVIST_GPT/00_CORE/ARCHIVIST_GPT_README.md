## üìå Purpose & Scope

`ARCHIVIST-GPT` is a specialized GPT agent designed to generate, update, summarize, and manage structured metadata entries for sim racing mods across multiple platforms ‚Äî starting with Assetto Corsa, and eventually extending to rFactor, Automobilista, Grand Prix Legends, and others.

Its function is archival in nature: to help preserve at-risk or scattered sim racing mods with meaningful, schema-compliant entries in the ASAP metadata archive.

---

## üß† Core Behaviors

ARCHIVIST operates under strict schema alignment and structured prompt module logic:

- Validates all entries against ASAP Metadata Schema (currently v1.2)
- Applies preservation-aware logic (e.g., risk inference, license tagging)
- Distinguishes between mod types: Cars, Tracks, Liveries, Collections, etc.
- Operates in cooperation with TECHNICAL-CONSULTANT and CONSULTANT

ARCHIVIST is schema-aware but not schema-defining.

## üß© Prompt Modules

| Prompt Module              | Description |
|---------------------------|-------------|
| `create_metadata_entry`   | Generates a full metadata entry from a user-supplied mod description |
| `lookup_metadata_entry`   | Retrieves a metadata entry from the archive using a unique asset ID |
| `update_metadata_entry`   | Applies a patch or update to an existing entry using UID and field data |
| `assist_with_field`       | Suggests a value for a missing field based on known context |
| `extract_from_text`       | Parses raw text (forum posts, readmes) to extract metadata |
| `summarize_metadata_entry`| Outputs a narrative-style mod summary based on existing metadata |
| `validate_metadata_entry` | Checks an entry for schema compliance and required fields |

Prompt modules are stored in `03_Prompt_Modules/` and documented individually.

## üß™ Testing & Examples

Test prompts for each module live in:

üìÇ `04_Tests/Prompt_Module_Examples/`

Each test includes:
- ‚úÖ Input prompt
- ‚úÖ Expected output
- ‚úÖ Module and schema version
- ‚úÖ Commentary on expected behavior

These can be used to regression test future ARCHIVIST versions or validate vault compliance.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations (v1.0)

- Metadata schema locking must be enforced externally (no in-GPT enforcement)
- No database connection or automatic entry persistence (yet)
- Simulator support is Assetto Corsa-focused during early phases
- No native schema drift detection
- Entry versioning is manual

---

## üìé Recommended Companion Roles

- `ASAP_TECHNICAL-CONSULTANT` for scripting and schema tooling
- `ASAP_ARCHIVIST-CONSULTANT` (this role) for development design and documentation


---

## üìò YAML Frontmatter (New Guidance)

- Some vault `.md` files now include YAML frontmatter for metadata consistency.
- These fields include: `schema_version`, `status`, `last_updated`, `title`.
- Prompt modules are not yet required to use this format but may adopt it in future versions.
- For structured files like schemas and changelogs, frontmatter should reflect vault status and schema versioning info.
