- Include the title, author (if known), and sim
- Note its type (car, track, collection, etc.)
- Mention any unique characteristics, quality level, or preservation status

If given an `asset_uid`, locate the associated metadata entry (from internal archive or shared context) and summarize it. Otherwise, assume the full metadata entry is provided.
