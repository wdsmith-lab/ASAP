In the present absence of a versioning workflow, some legacy documents are retained here for reference or inclusion in a repository.

***NOTE:*** Do *not* remove locked prior versions of metadata schema from the ASAP_ARCHIVIST-GPT/01_Schema folder.  These should be retained there so that ARCHIVIST has reference to the full schema of previous official iterations (ie. [[ASAP_Metadata_Schema_v1.1]])
