Letâ€™s make the most of your session. Hereâ€™s a proposed **quick-start progression**, assuming ~30 minutes:

---

## ðŸ§ª TECHNICAL WORK SESSION (Bash Environment Bootstrap â€“ Part 1)

### âœ… Step 1: Setup Project Folder for Scripts (5 min)

We'll create a folder where you'll store reusable scripts related to vault hygiene and metadata tooling.

bash

CopyEdit

`mkdir -p ~/asap-tools/scripts cd ~/asap-tools/scripts`

Let me know if you'd prefer a different path â€” this is your dev zone.

### âœ… Step 2: First Script â€“ Status Field Validator (10â€“15 min)

Letâ€™s create a Bash script that:

- Scans a directory of `.md` files
    
- Extracts the `Status:` field from the frontmatter or top lines
    
- Compares it to the fileâ€™s name suffix (`_LOCKED.md`, `_DRAFT.md`, etc.)
    
- Flags mismatches for review
    

This will serve as:

- Your first reusable script
    
- A real-world validator tied to vault integrity
    
- A pattern you can grow from
    

---

### âœ… Step 3: Make Executable and Portable (5 min)

Weâ€™ll walk through:

- Adding the script to `$PATH` (optionally)
    
- Using `chmod +x`
    
- Ensuring it runs from any location
    

---

### âœ… Optional Step 4: README Bootstrap or Script Registry

If thereâ€™s time, we can start a lightweight Markdown index of your available tools (future state of `_bin/` or `tools.md`), to keep things portable and explainable.
