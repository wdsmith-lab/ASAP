# ASAP – Mission and Ethos
%% Can still be changed by WillDeeEss, but for functional purposes, is considered **locked** %%
ASAP, the Automobile Simulation Archival Project, is a preservation-focused initiative dedicated to ensuring that digital racing simulation assets — especially community-created mods like vehicles, tracks, and associated materials — are not lost to time.

Its core mission is to catalog, document, and archive these materials with detailed metadata and integrity tracking.

The long-term purpose is to create a resilient, discoverable, and community-respectful resource that not only preserves the mods themselves but also contextualizes their lineage and significance.

ASAP values service, transparency, and non-intrusiveness, aiming to coexist harmoniously with creators and existing modding ecosystems.

Ultimately, ASAP aspires to serve the community by safeguarding sim racing history before it vanishes.
