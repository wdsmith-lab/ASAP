# Automobile Simulation Archival Project (ASAP)

This repository contains the Obsidian vault for the ASAP project.

ASAP is focused on preserving legacy car simulation mods with metadata, genealogy, and permission tracking â€” blending scriptable metadata management, prompt modules, and GPT integration.

## ðŸ”§ Structure

- `_bin/` â€“ Validation scripts and CLI tools
- `01_Schema/` â€“ Metadata schema versions and changelogs
- `02_Prompt Module/` â€“ Prompt module templates
- `ARCHIVIST-CONSULTANT/` â€“ Development notes for ARCHIVIST-GPT
- `_etc/` â€“ Notes, naming conventions, review checklists

## ðŸ§ª Vault Compatibility

- Optimized for use with Obsidian
- Markdown-native with YAML frontmatter where appropriate
- Git-ready with minimal excluded UI/configuration files

## ðŸ“¦ Git Integration

If cloning or initializing locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/asap.git
cd asap
```

Ensure you commit only necessary content by respecting the `.gitignore`.
