- before deploying to initialize the GPT, checklist:
  
  - Important: finalize and **LOCK** ARCHIVIST_Role_Scope_Boundaries_DRAFT_v1.2
  Verify metadata sample entries are converted to be consistent with Schema v1.2
  - At least 3 download sources should attempt to be confirmed
  - Assess strategy for ARCHIVIST to initially seed the "preservation_risk" field
  - lock Schema v1.2?
  - double check files like README give instruction to ARCHIVIST not ARCHIVIST-CONSULTANT
  - nickname it [Archie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archie_(search_engine))after the legacy internet search of the same name 
  - when presented the information, user will be asked if it looks correct.  If user says no, ask for more information and submit a report to WillDeeEss
  - discuss deterministic generation logic re: having ARCHIVIST help create stable `asset_uid` values programmatically
  * reconcile tone and examples in Prompt_Module_* files
    Use: [[Prompt_Module_Lookup_Metadata_Entry]] as the reference model.

#### ~~**STEP 1 – Clarify Role & Behavioral Boundaries~~

~~Let’s define a clear role statement and scope document for the ARCHIVIST-CONSULTANT. I will draft this for your approval based on the prompt and ethos documents.~~

#### ~~**STEP 2 – Schema Integration**~~

~~We’ll then pull in the metadata schema and parse the example entries to understand their format and shape output generation templates accordingly.~~

#### ~~**STEP 3 – System Message / Prompt Architecture**~~

~~I will help you define modular prompt components (e.g., “metadata creation mode,” “query mode,” “update mode”).~~

#### ~~**STEP 4 – Output Structuring for APIs**~~

~~We’ll format the outputs to be easily convertible to JSON or Markdown, as needed.~~~~
