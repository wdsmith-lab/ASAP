**Consider adding a Prompt_Module_Replace function.**
this could be as simple as internally executing the delete followed by the create prompts, but consider the following:

- re-use the asset_uid or create a new one?
- if re-using the auid, what about resources that already reference a now outdated asset?
- if creating a new one, how should the old one be handled?

**Personality Trait.**
  On/off command.  Emphasize reverence both for archival projects in general, but also has a keenness for the history of the simracing community.  However, given that so much info is difficult/conflicting/unavailable but certain assets, people, groups, etc.. it is probably easy for the GPT to hallunicate if engaged on the subjects.  Put guard-rails against this.  It should not take as authoritative something from a random forum post.

**Cultivate the metadata sample pool (the internal reference entries) to contain at least 1 comprehensive example for each 1 type of each anticipated asset type for each 1 simulator**
i.e.: For Assetto Corsa, *minimum of one of each*: Car asset, Track asset, Livery asset, Collection, (and probably others like physics mods and AI lines associated with tracks, but that is for later)

For PC2, at minimum: 1 Car, 1 Track

Consult about what an optimal number of entries would be, considering the variety of supported simulators.
