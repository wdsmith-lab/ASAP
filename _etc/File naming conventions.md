Here's a question that isn't exactly ASAP specific, just Will being Will. Is it considered best practices to append the '_LOCKED' to locked the filename? (And if so, should I extend that to 'ASAP_Metada_Schema_v1.1.md' ?) even though 'Status: locked' is in the .md file itself?

###### ChatGPT said:

Ah yes — a classic “Will-being-Will” question, and a good one.  
Here’s a well-rounded take grounded in **best practices, clarity, and maintainability** — both for human teams and machine agents.

## 🔒 Should You Append `_LOCKED` to the Filename?

### ✅ **Pros of Appending `_LOCKED`**

|Benefit|Why It Matters|
|---|---|
|**Clarity at a glance**|Instantly signals immutability without opening the file|
|**Version control hygiene**|Makes diffs and final state transitions more explicit|
|**Automation-friendly**|Tools/scripts/GPTs can distinguish between draft/final versions without parsing content|
|**Auditability**|Makes change history easier to follow in flat views or archives|
|**Alignment with conventions**|Mirrors common suffixing like `_DRAFT`, `_FINAL`, `_ARCHIVED`, etc.|

> ✅ **Conclusion**: Appending `_LOCKED` is a lightweight but very useful convention, especially in mixed-use projects like ASAP (humans + GPT agents).

## 🤔 What About Older Versions (e.g., `v1.1`)?

If you're **preserving v1.1 as a historical reference** and consider it a finalized schema:

- Renaming it to `ASAP_Metadata_Schema_v1.1_LOCKED.md` is reasonable **if** it was officially finalized and should never be modified again.
    
- However, if it’s more of an **archived legacy** (never formally locked), you could instead use:
    
    - `ASAP_Metadata_Schema_v1.1_ARCHIVED.md`
        
    - or just leave it as-is with an internal `Status: Archived` or `Status: Superseded` header.
        

> 📝 Tip: Match internal metadata to filename (`Status: Locked` → `_LOCKED.md`, `Status: Draft` → `_DRAFT.md`, etc.)

## 📦 Suggested Naming Policy for ASAP Schema Files

| File Status     | Filename Pattern                                   | Example                                 |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Active Draft    | `ASAP_Metadata_Schema_vX.X_DRAFT.md`               | `ASAP_Metadata_Schema_v1.3_DRAFT.md`    |
| Final & Locked  | `ASAP_Metadata_Schema_vX.X_LOCKED.md`              | `ASAP_Metadata_Schema_v1.2_LOCKED.md`   |
| Archived Legacy | `ASAP_Metadata_Schema_vX.X_ARCHIVED.md` (optional) | `ASAP_Metadata_Schema_v1.1_ARCHIVED.md` |

This naming pattern is future-proof, GPT-friendly, and scales cleanly.

Excellent explanation, thank you. So my follow-up: given that 'Status:' is in the file contents, does this convention not introduce the likelihood of mismatch due to oversight? That is: the file name suggests LOCKED but the contents suggest Draft.

###### ChatGPT said:

Yes — _you've nailed the critical tradeoff._  
Appending `_LOCKED` (or `_DRAFT`, `_ARCHIVED`, etc.) **improves external clarity** but **introduces a new point of failure**: potential mismatch between the filename and the internal `Status:` field.

Let’s break it down:

## 🔁 Dual Source of Truth: Filename vs. Status Field

### 🔍 Risk: **Inconsistency or Drift**

| Scenario                                                         | Outcome                                        |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `ASAP_Metadata_Schema_v1.3_LOCKED.md` has `Status: Draft` inside | Confusing, especially for automation or audits |
| Internal status is updated but filename is not (or vice versa)   | Misinterpretation by humans or GPT agents      |
| Backup/archive copies use outdated status                        | Increases maintenance burden                   |

## ✅ Best Practices to Mitigate Mismatch

### 1. **Treat Filename and Status as Joint Canon**

- The filename suffix is **like a tag** — useful, visible, actionable
    
- The internal `Status:` is **like a certificate** — definitive, explicit, GPT-readable
    

💡 _Rule of thumb:_ **Only add a status suffix to the filename when you’re also updating the `Status:` inside the file.** They must always be updated in tandem.

---

### 2. **Automate Consistency Checks (Optional for You)**

In larger projects, or ones with CI/CD pipelines or metadata agents, you could:

- Add a linter or Markdown pre-commit hook to verify `filename_suffix == Status`
    
- Use GPT to periodically scan and flag mismatches (e.g., as part of a vault QA pass)
    

---

### 3. **Use a Version Tracker File as Source of Truth**

Which you’ve basically done with:

- `ASAP_Metadata_Schema_Index.md`
    
- `ASAP_Metadata_Schema_CHANGELOG.md`
    

This reduces risk by centralizing version lineage, current status, and relationships across files.

## 🧭 What I Recommend for ASAP

Since you’re operating both manually and with GPT assistance:

- ✅ **Keep using `_LOCKED`** in filenames — especially for canonical versions
    
- ✅ **Always verify `Status:` internally when locking** (as you’ve been doing)
    
- 🚫 Avoid using `_DRAFT` in filenames unless you're actively collaborating and want external cues
    
- 💡 Add a short note to your README or vault manifest documenting this convention:
    
    > “Status suffixes in filenames (e.g., `_LOCKED`) must always match the internal `Status:` field.”

Would you like a small script or checklist to validate filename vs. `Status:` in markdown headers as a pre-lock routine?

##### You said:

Oh yes, please provide both the script and the checklist in a .zip for me to look at. Cool, I understand the practice and the tradeoff. I'll remember your suggested rule of thumb.
