# ✅ ASAP_TECHNICAL-CONSULTANT Session Summary – Bash Environment & Tooling Foundations

**Date:** 2025-07-02  
**Prepared For:** `ARCHIVIST-CONSULTANT`  
**Prepared By:** `ASAP_TECHNICAL-CONSULTANT`

## 📍 Session Focus

This session established a foundational technical environment and kicked off early metadata hygiene tooling to support the construction and sustainability of the ARCHIVIST-GPT system.

---

## ✅ Completed Milestones

### 🧰 Bash + WSL Development Environment
- Set up **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL 2)** with Ubuntu on Windows 11.
- Installed **Visual Studio Code** (not Visual Studio), resolved marketplace installation issues.
- Integrated VS Code with WSL using the `Remote - WSL` extension.
- Established a base folder: `~/asap-tools/scripts/` for reusable CLI tooling.

---

### 🛠 Initial Tool: `check_status_consistency`
A Python-based CLI tool that validates consistency between a file’s `Status:` field and its filename suffix.

#### Features:
- Scans `.md` files for `Status:` consistency.
- Reports mismatches, missing data, or matches.
- Supports both **recursive** and **non-recursive** directory scans.
- Optionally outputs results in **JSON format** for later automation or validation pipelines.

#### Revisions:
- **v1:** Single-folder scanner, Markdown-agnostic.
- **v2:** Enhanced to:
  - Handle Markdown formatting (`**Status**:`)
  - Strip emojis (✅, ❌, etc.)
  - Add `--non-recursive` option

---

### 🔀 Strategic Pivot: YAML Frontmatter Adoption

After discovering Markdown formatting inconsistencies in metadata files, the user decided to shift to a **hybrid structure**:

- ✅ YAML frontmatter for structured, machine-readable metadata fields.
- ✅ Markdown body for rich notes, changelogs, and field-level guidance.

**Affected Files (manually converted by user):**
- `ASAP_Metadata_Schema_v1.2_LOCKED.md`
- `ASAP_Metadata_Schema_v1.3_DRAFT.md`
- `ASAP_Metadata_Schema_CHANGELOG.md`

Future tools will support **both** formats, defaulting to YAML frontmatter if present.

---

## 🧭 Notes & Recommendations for ARCHIVIST-CONSULTANT

- ✅ YAML frontmatter should now be considered canonical for metadata fields like `status`, `schema_version`, etc.
- ❗ Prompt modules (e.g., `create_metadata_entry`, `summarize_metadata_entry`) should be updated to look for and emit frontmatter format as default.
- 📦 The technical assistant (`ASAP_TECHNICAL-CONSULTANT`) will deliver a YAML-aware upgrade to the `check_status_consistency` tool next, and gradually migrate additional vault scripts to be schema-aware.
- 📁 Vault metadata validation tooling will eventually evolve into a `make validate` or `just`-style automation CLI for vault integrity tasks.

---

## 📌 Standing by

`ASAP_TECHNICAL-CONSULTANT` is now fully seeded and available to support:

- Further script development
- Schema migration utilities
- Vault automation
- Git/version control policies
